          Introduction
        </button>
        <div class="panel" style="max-height: 1000px">
          <p>
            In 2011, the then Vice President Joe Biden proclaimed that China’s
            rise isn’t America’s demise in an opinion article published in the
            New York Times. That amiability between the two nations ten years
            ago is hard to imagine today: in 2022, he announced a chip ban to
            thwart Chinese tech development, named China as a long-term national
            security threat, and talked of “China’s challenge.”
          </p>

          <p>
            It is interesting that one year after Biden’s proclamation marks a
            reversal in US public opinion of China. According to Pew data,
            before 2012, generally more Americans held a favorable view of China
            than an unfavorable one. After 2012, that trend switched and
            continued until today, where unfavorable views of China reached
            historic highs.
          </p>

          <p>
            With China, whether looking inward or outward, there is always a
            lens. Today’s Chinese citizens use VPN to see the world beyond the
            Great Firewall. Throughout much of history, the American public sees
            China through the media’s account, which has not always been
            consistent. In the early days of the People’s Republic of China, the
            media painted it as a rogue state endangering the world order.
            Nixon’s visit and the normalization of relations between the two
            countries assuaged the earlier attitude. The media became more
            approving of China’s progress — a view that was briefly disrupted by
            the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, but largely continued into the
            2010s.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the surface, it does not seem like there’s anything remarkable
            about the year 2012. Sure, it was the year Xi Jinping gained
            prominence in the Chinese Communist Party, but his authoritarian
            tendencies were not apparent yet (Biden talks of Xi’s cooperative
            attitude in his article). As such, I want to understand how the
            media is involved in the unexpected public opinion reversal through
            analyzing both what is covered and how topics are covered in the
            years around 2012.
          </p>

          <p>
            I posit that it is both possible for the media portrayal to lead
            public opinion, and for public opinion to skew media portrayal.
            Analyzing whether the shift in choice of coverage and angle of
            coverage occurred before or after 2012 will allow me to say with
            higher certainty that one trend precedes the other and that a
            correlation exists. Of course, this would not allow me to prove the
            existence of a causal relationship, but understanding how the media
            influences public opinion would be an enlightening demonstration of
            the power of media coverage.

          Key Findings
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            In order to answer the question, I looked at print publications with
            traditionally different angles of reporting: the New York Times, the
            Wall Street Journal, Time magazine, and the Financial Times. I
            analyzed coverage via Google searches with specific domains, 1-year
            time range, and key words that involve China.
          </p>

          <p>Through doing so, I have made the following key findings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Before 2009, coverage of China in the military context was scant.
              This started to change around 2011, and by 2012-2013, coverage of
              the Chinese military exploded. The Wall Street Journal noted the
              Chinese navy expansion, and the New York Times picked up on
              China’s cybersecurity threat in 2013.
            </li>
            <li>
              China appeared on the cover of Time magazine five times in the
              period from 2005 to 2013. The two in 2005 and 2011 carried a tone
              of fascination, whereas the three after 2011 were more
              significantly more negative.
            </li>
            <li>
              Around 2010, the Financial Times started reporting the more
              restrictive policies in China, and business exits from China, a
              change from earlier era’s emphasis on the business opportunities
              in China.
            </li>
            <li>
              The New York Times coverage of the Tibetan protests that lasted
              from 2008 to 2012 show a change in tone and positioning that was
              growingly critical of the Chinese government.
            </li>
            <li>
              In international relations, coverage of China’s conflicts with its
              neighbors increased around 2010.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These findings suggest that there is both a change in what is
            covered and how they are covered in mainstream print media. Because
            the shifts seem to be occurring before the 2012 reversal in public
            opinion, there is reason to believe that the media might have played
            a role in leading American views of China.

          Reporting the Chinese Military
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Before 2010 and 2012 respectively, the Wall Street Journal and the
            Financial Times did not cover the Chinese military. Before 2008, the
            New York Times coverage of the Chinese military was both limited and
            matter of fact: in 2008, it covered the Chinese military in context
            of the deadly Sichuan earthquake.
          </p>

          <p>
            After 2009, more stories about conflicts started appearing. The
            Times briefly covered a South China Sea incident between the US and
            Chinese navy. While giving a voice to both sides, the coverage
            painted China as more confrontational, with words such as China
            “lashed out” at the US. In 2010, the Times published stories about
            the expansion of Chinese naval power, but it rationalized the
            Chinese military’s new assertiveness with its “inexperience on the
            world stage” and remains optimistic that “renewed cooperation” will
            lead to better outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            While its prior coverage of China focused on the Chinese economy,
            the Wall Street Journal started publishing more stories about
            China’s military advancements after 2011: new stealth fighter
            (2011), new destroyer (2012), new heavy military transport plane
            (2013), and multiple stories about the new aircraft carrier (2012).
            This is a stark contrast from earlier periods, as deployments of
            Chinese nuclear submarines were not covered.
          </p>

          <p>
            The increased exposure of China’s military advancements is coupled
            with increased reporting of China’s military ambition. In 2011, a
            story about China’s naval presence in Indian Ocean; in 2012, a
            detailed article about China’s military catchup to the US; in 2013,
            coverage of “The China Dream” in military context — all of these
            portray China no longer as a regional power in East Asia and trade
            partner of the US, but more as a rising power with global ambitions
            and rapid development. With this shift in coverage, the Wall Street
            Journal was pursuing a different path for depicting China. Instead
            of thinking of China as just another part of the world, it is giving
            China more emphasis and pronouncing its capabilities and thus its
            potential threat.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2013, the New York Times covered the Chinese military-backed
            cyber attacks extensively. Said to be conducted by a unit of the
            People’s Liberation Army, the direct attack targeted US government
            computers, defense contractors, and the New York Times itself. The
            extensive coverage that spanned several stories meant wider
            circulation of the news, which likely alarmed the general public
            about a malicious China. The news posed China differently, as a
            rival to be contended with, as a problem that the US has set aside
            for too long and requires attention (the article noted how this is a
            remarkable criticism from the Pentagon, which previously avoided
            accusing the Chinese government or military for using cyberweapons
            for deliberate action).
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, there is a clear increase in coverage of Chinese military
            capability that started in 2011. While not doing so explicitly, the
            media implicitly point to the potential of the Chinese threat by
            choosing to tell stories about Chinese military programs and
            ambitions. It is important to note that before 2011, China did
            launch new weapons, modernize its military, and originate cyber
            attacks — but those news slipped through the US media lens. The
            revelation of such activities, perhaps for the first time for many
            Americans, would logically lead Americans to see China as beyond an
            economic powerhouse, be more wary of China, question Chinese
            intentions, and thus, view China less favorably.

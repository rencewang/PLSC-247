          Introduction

        <div class="panel" style="max-height: 1000px">
          <p>
            In 2011, the then Vice President Joe Biden proclaimed that
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/opinion/chinas-rise-isnt-our-demise.html"

              China’s rise isn’t America’s demise</a
            >
            in an opinion article published in the <i>New York Times</i>. That
            amiability between the two nations ten years ago is hard to imagine
            today: in 2022, he announced a
            <a

              >China’s challenge</a
            >.”
          </p>

          <p>
            It is interesting that one year after Biden’s proclamation marks a
            reversal in US public opinion of China. According to Pew data,
            before 2012, generally more Americans held a favorable view of China
            than an unfavorable one. After 2012, that trend switched and
            continued until today, where unfavorable views of China reached
            historic highs.
          </p>

          <p>
            With China, whether looking inward or outward, there is always a
            lens. Today’s Chinese citizens use VPN to see the world beyond the
            Great Firewall. Throughout much of history, the American public sees
            China through the media’s account, which
            <a
              href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2020/american-news-medias-volatile-perspectives-china#"
              target="_blank"
              >has not always been consistent</a
            >. In the early days of the People’s Republic of China, the media
            painted it as a rogue state endangering the world order. Nixon’s
            visit and the normalization of relations between the two countries
            assuaged the earlier attitude. The media became more approving of
            China’s progress — a view that was briefly disrupted by the 1989
            Tiananmen Square incident, but largely continued into the 2010s.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the surface, it does not seem like there’s anything remarkable
            about the year 2012. Sure, it was the year Xi Jinping gained
            prominence in the Chinese Communist Party, but his authoritarian
            tendencies were not apparent yet (Biden talks of Xi’s cooperative
            attitude in his article). As such, I want to understand how the
            media is involved in the unexpected public opinion reversal through
            analyzing both what is covered and how topics are covered in the
            years around 2012.
          </p>

          <p>
            I posit that it is both possible for the media portrayal to lead
            public opinion, and for public opinion to skew media portrayal.
            Analyzing whether the shift in choice of coverage and angle of
            coverage occurred before or after 2012 will allow me to say with
            higher certainty that one trend precedes the other and that a
            correlation exists. Of course, this would not allow me to prove the
            existence of a causal relationship, but understanding how the media
            influences public opinion would be an enlightening demonstration of
            the power of media coverage.

          Key Findings
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            In order to answer the question, I looked at print publications with
            traditionally different angles of reporting: the
            <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>,
            <i>Time</i> magazine, and the <i>Financial Times</i>. I analyzed
            coverage via Google searches with specific domains, 1-year time
            range, and key words that involve China.
          </p>

          <p>Through doing so, I have made the following key findings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Before 2009, coverage of China in the military context was scant.
              This started to change around 2011, and by 2012-2013, coverage of
              the Chinese military exploded. The
              <i>Wall Street Journal</i> noted the Chinese navy expansion, and
              the <i>New York Times</i> picked up on China’s cybersecurity
              threat in 2013.
            </li>
            <li>
              China appeared on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine five times in
              the period from 2005 to 2013. The two in 2005 and 2011 carried a
              tone of fascination, whereas the three after 2011 were more
              significantly more negative.
            </li>
            <li>
              Around 2010, the <i>Financial Times</i> started reporting the more
              restrictive policies in China, and
              <a

                href="https://www.ft.com/content/9271a266-8d21-11de-a540-00144feabdc0"
                target="_blank"
                >business</a
              >

                target="_blank"
                >opportunities</a
              >
              in China.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <i>New York Times</i> coverage of the Tibetan protests that
              lasted from 2008 to 2012 show a change in tone and positioning
              that was growingly critical of the Chinese government.
            </li>
            <li>
              In international relations, coverage of China’s conflicts with its
              neighbors increased around 2010.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These findings suggest that there is both a change in what is
            covered and how they are covered in mainstream print media. Because
            the shifts seem to be occurring before the 2012 reversal in public
            opinion, there is reason to believe that the media might have played
            a role in leading American views of China.

          Reporting the Chinese Military

        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Before 2010 and 2012 respectively, the
            <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and the <i>Financial Times</i> did not
            cover the Chinese military. Before 2008, the
            <i>New York Times</i> coverage of the Chinese military was both
            limited and matter of fact: in 2008, it covered the Chinese military

            of the deadly Sichuan earthquake.
          </p>

          <p>
            After 2009, more stories about conflicts started appearing. The
            <i>Times</i> briefly covered a South China Sea incident between the
            <a

            navy. While giving a voice to both sides, the coverage painted China
            as more confrontational, with words such as China “lashed out” at
            the US. In 2010, the <i>Times</i> published stories about the
            expansion of Chinese

          </p>

          <p>
            While its prior coverage of China focused on the Chinese economy,
            the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> started publishing more stories about
            China’s military advancements after 2011: new

            deployments of Chinese nuclear submarines were not covered.
          </p>

          <p>
            The increased exposure of China’s military advancements is coupled
            with increased reporting of China’s military ambition. In 2011, a
            story about China’s

              >“The China Dream” in military context</a
            >
            — all of these portray China no longer as a regional power in East
            Asia and trade partner of the US, but more as a rising power with
            global ambitions and rapid development. With this shift in coverage,
            the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> was pursuing a different path for
            depicting China. Instead of thinking of China as just another part
            of the world, it is giving China more emphasis and pronouncing its
            capabilities and thus its potential threat.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2013, the <i>New York Times</i> covered the
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >extensively</a
            >. Said to be conducted by a unit of the People’s Liberation Army,
            the direct attack targeted US government computers, defense
            contractors, and the <i>Times</i> itself. The extensive coverage
            that spanned several stories meant wider circulation of the news,
            which likely alarmed the general public about a malicious China. The
            news posed China differently, as a rival to be contended with, as a
            problem that the US has set aside for too long and requires
            attention (the article noted how this is a remarkable criticism from
            the Pentagon, which previously avoided accusing the Chinese
            government or military for using cyberweapons for deliberate
            action).
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, there is a clear increase in coverage of Chinese military
            capability that started in 2011. While not doing so explicitly, the
            media implicitly point to the potential of the Chinese threat by
            choosing to tell stories about Chinese military programs and
            ambitions. It is important to note that before 2011, China did
            launch new weapons, modernize its military, and originate cyber
            attacks — but those news slipped through the US media lens. The
            revelation of such activities, perhaps for the first time for many
            Americans, would logically lead Americans to see China as beyond an
            economic powerhouse, be more wary of China, question Chinese
            intentions, and thus, view China less favorably.

          Seeing China Through Time Magazine
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            <i>Time</i> magazine, published weekly with the majority of its
            readership in the US, tells interesting stories through its covers.
            Some of its covers have been iconic and greatly influential. Due to
            the composition of its readership, many of its covers reflect
            domestic issues, which makes its relatively limited covers about
            foreign issues especially valuable. The portrayal of China on the
            cover of <i>Time</i> magazine changed in 2011, closely correlated to
            the public opinion reversal that Pew observes.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the 2000s, China was not frequently featured on the covers of
            Time. The June 27, 2005 issue, titled “<span
              onclick="changeWebpage('content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20050627,00.html')"
              >China’s New Revolution</span
            >,” shows the official portrait of Mao Zedong dressed in a Louis
            Vuitton coat. The
            <span
              onclick="changeWebpage('content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1074151,00.html')"
              >cover story</span
            >
            underlines China’s status as the world factory, its economic rise,
            and its agenda for stability. It tells the story of how economic
            performance would lead to political stability, and then it's all fun
            for everyone involved — the Chinese factory workers, the Chinese
            government, the US, everyone else.
          </p>

          <p>
            In October 2011, the cover of a child blowing a Chinese-flag-colored
            bubble, titled “<span
              onclick="changeWebpage('content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20111031,00.html')"
              >The China Bubble</span
            >,” had a similar narrative. The
            <span
              onclick="changeWebpage('content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,2097400,00.html')"

            leads with China's economic miracle that materialized in the
            luxuries enjoyed by the Chinese nouveau riche, then compares it to
            the poor economic situation that Western countries found themselves
            in. Multinational corporations are excited to expand in China in a
            move tagged by the article as “the reverse Marco Polo.” Judging from
            what <i>Time</i> chose to report, enthusiasm about China seems to be
            at an all time high.
          </p>

          <p>
            But it all came to an abrupt stop. In 2012, the two covers that
            involved China were much more negative. On May 14, 2012, the cover
            was the face of Bo Xilai painted in red — with the title “<span
              onclick="changeWebpage('content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20120514,00.html')"
              >The People’s Republic of Scandal</span
            >.” Bo was a contender for the top spot in the Communist Party who
            lost to Xi Jinping, with rumors circulating that he had intentions
            to stage a coup. The
            <span
              onclick="changeWebpage('content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,2113802,00.html')"
              >cover story</span
            >
            exposed that piece of political drama, with insights about the
            corruption and crimes within the Party.
          </p>

          <p>
            The October 22 cover echoed the previous one: this time Xi Jinping’s
            portrait is filtered with red. The title read “<span
              onclick="changeWebpage('content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20121022,00.html')"
              >The Next Leader of the Unfree World</span
            >.” In the article, the focus was the beaten hopes that China would
            continue to liberalize. Even though the article could not see into
            the future about Xi’s authoritarian reign, the sensational cover
            showed a clear change in attitude.
          </p>

          <p>
            The June 17
            <span
              onclick="changeWebpage('content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20130617,00.html')"
              >cover</span
            >
            in 2013 is a culmination of the change. The article chose to cover
            the cultural, political, and military ambitions of Xi’s China. The
            cover’s title, “The World According to China,” depicts an otherness,
            an inherent conflict of viewpoints — the sense that China carries a
            foreign agenda.
          </p>

          <p>
            Altogether, the <i>Time</i> covers post-2011 recounted political
            drama and corruption, emphasized China’s political and ideological
            differences from the US, and positioned stories through an angle of
            an ambitious China’s rise. Through shifts in tone and perspective,
            it reminded its American audience that China is not just the
            glimmering economic miracle that its prior coverage revealed, but
            also an ideological outcast that is growing stronger. Because the
            change in Time’s attitude occurred right around 2011, it might have
            negatively affected the public opinion of China and contributed to
            the reversal in views of China.

          Changing View of Tibetan Protests
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            One of the sources of instability in China in the late 2000s was the
            protest in Tibet, in response to both racial tension and government
            policies. When protests erupted in 2008, the
            <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
            positioned the issue as partly fueled by
            <a
              href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120661528938768371"
              target="_blank"
              >classist struggle</a
            >
            amongst the Tibetans. Instead of placing much scrutiny on the
            government response to the protests or treatment of protestors, it
            delineated how the split between those who cooperated with the
            government, who believe that “Lhasa has developed so much since the
            1970s,” and those who did not, who “detest [the Tibetans] who got
            educated in the Han system and then turned their backs on [them].”
            By focusing on the wealth gap and patriotism, the
            <i>Journal</i> coverage excused the government’s role in prompting
            the protests and played down the crackdown that ensued.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both the <i>Journal</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> posed the
            issue more like a riot in 2008. The Times initial
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/world/asia/15tibet.html"
              target="_blank"
              >coverage</a
            >
            emphasized violence both against the police and potentially to the
            people. By showing that soldiers died, that Tibetans were “beating
            Chinese residents with iron rods,” that mobs “set fire to a police
            car and a store owned by a Chinese shopkeeper,” and by ending the
            story with how a Chinese family feared for their safety, the article
            seems to sympathize with the Chinese locals and the police and paint
            the protesters as violent. A similar portrayal was in its
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/world/asia/24tibet.html"

              >inside look</a
            >
            at Tibet, published several days later.
          </p>

          <p>
            When
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/world/asia/31china.html"
              target="_blank"
              >discussing the crackdown</a
            >
            that ensued, the <i>Times</i> took the angle of growing nationalism
            in China. By quoting the nationalist sentiment of Meng Huizhong, the
            article presented a government whose hands were tied by nationalism,
            whose decision to crack down on the protests was motivated by the
            concern for its electorate. While the article talked about how the
            Chinese Communist Party’s extensive nationalist propaganda of the
            past was to blame, it ascribes less agency to the government. For
            the American reader in 2008, the coverage of violent protests and
            rationalization for the government might have meant that they would
            find the Chinese people sympathetic and the government’s actions
            reasonable.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the issue dragged on to 2012, however, the <i>New York Times</i>
            coverage was different. The Chinese government was directly
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/world/asia/in-self-immolations-signs-of-new-turmoil-in-tibet.html"
              target="_blank"
              >placed at fault</a
            >
            for the self-immolations in Tibet, by stating that school policies
            “incited” protests and describing the “monastic management” plan of
            the government. This was already different from prior coverage that
            did little to explain government policy that might have caused
            protests. Furthermore, the vivid description of the scene of Tsering
            Kyi’s self-immolation and the treatment of the monks likely
            attracted sympathy for them and antipathy for the government.
          </p>

          <p>
            The
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/world/asia/chinese-crack-down-to-curb-spread-of-tibetan-unrest.html"
              target="_blank"
              >crackdown</a
            >
            was also covered differently in 2012 by the <i>Times</i>. The
            sources are more critical of the Chinese government. The unrest was
            seen as a struggle against “Chinese repression of political and
            religious freedoms.” The Chinese forces were shown “firing on and
            killing some demonstrators.” Deaths were described on both the
            Tibetan side and the Han Chinese and police side. The government was
            portrayed using “intimidating tactics to make sure information isn’t
            disseminated.” Overall, the article depicted the government’s firm
            hand in a ruthless, organized crackdown — very different from the
            2008 depiction of “wavering” government forces.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consequently, there is a clear shift in positioning that the
            <i>New York Times</i> adopted between 2008 and 2012. The clear
            sympathy with Tibetans and clear illustration of government
            ill-doings likely painted a worse image of China for Americans,
            especially as the coverage sparked memories of the 1989 crackdown.

        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Another interesting facet was how China’s conflicts with its
            neighbors were covered. The <i>New York Times</i> covered China’s
            activity in the South China Sea, in 2010 with
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/world/asia/05hanoi.html"
              target="_blank"
              >Vietnam</a
            >
            and 2012 with
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/asia/beijing-projects-power-in-strategic-south-china-sea.html"
              target="_blank"
              >the Philippines</a
            >. The difference in coverage is clear from the headlines: “Vietnam
            Seeks Negotiating Partners in Conflict With China Over Islands”
            versus “Beijing Projects Power in Strategic South China Sea.” One
            places Vietnam as the subject, the other Beijing. One shows
            negotiations in progress, the other shows China actively projecting
            power.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 2010 article centered around Vietnam’s attempts in enlisting
            international support to limit China’s reach. The 2012 article,
            however, used the conflict between China and the Philippines as a
            proxy for China posing a challenge for the US. An ex-Filipino
            official was quoted as saying “China is testing the United States,”
            and a Chinese official was quoted dismissing any legitimate role of
            the US in the South China Sea.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both issues were about Chinese claims in the South China Sea, but
            the different angles of coverage left different impressions for the
            audience: one of China as a regional power, one of China as a
            challenger of US primacy. Similar to increased coverage of the
            Chinese military, the change in framing here might have worsened
            China’s image for the American audience, as the unyielding and
            aggressive side of China comes into view.

          Conclusion
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            All the above changes occurred around 2011 and 2012, which is
            generally before the public opinion reversal documented by
            <span
              onclick="changeWebpage('www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/07/30/americans-fault-china-for-its-role-in-the-spread-of-covid-19/pg_20-07-30_u-s-views-china_0-01/')"
              >Pew</span
            >. Consequently, it is more likely that the shift in media coverage
            led to souring public opinion rather than being pulled by public
            opinion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The choice of coverage is especially important for foreign issues,
            simply because of how few articles there are. For instance, the
            conflict between China and Vietnam in 2010 amounted to a single
            article in the <i>New York Times</i>, and the
            <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
            had little to nothing to say about the Tibetan unrest after 2009.
            Thus, it is very likely that the choice and framing of coverage of
            foreign countries significantly impacts the general public’s
            conception of places such as China, particularly in the early 2010s
            when mainstream media was still most people’s main news source.
          </p>

          <p>
            As to why the media changed its tone and choice of coverage, I have
            several hypotheses. First is a shift in leadership style, from the
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/world/asia/17china.html"
              target="_blank"
              >dissonant leadership</a
            >
            of President Hu Jintao to the
            <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/world/asia/chinas-new-leader-xi-jinping-takes-full-power.html"
              target="_blank"
              >iron fist</a
            >
            of President Xi Jinping. China did become more forceful in
            international relations, more unafraid to show off its military,
            more firm in its pursuit of a security state. Second might be the US
            media’s disillusion by the broken prospects of further reform and
            opening. China opened access to the <i>New York Times</i> website in
            2001 under President Jiang Zeming, a signal of potential relaxation
            of rules on the media and civil society. However, it re-<a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/asia/china-blocks-web-access-to-new-york-times.html"
              target="_blank"
              >blocked access</a
            >
            in 2012, seemingly on a whim. After many years of amicable waiting
            for a freer China and more transparent regime, perhaps the optimism
            wore off.
          </p>

          <p>
            Either way, the shifts in media perspective is clear. With the
            change in coverage and tone, it is not surprising that Americans
            would see a new China — corrupt, cruel, ambitious — rather than the
            old portrayal — land of opportunity and economic growth.
